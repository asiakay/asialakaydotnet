      <h5 class="m-3 font-weight-bold" >Asia K., <i>Software Developer</i></h5>
      <p>A life-long learner, I am inspired to continue learning about the history, current practices, and future trends impacting design thinking, build processes, and the software development life cycle. </p>

      <p>Transitioning into a tech career has been a blessing. I'm grateful for the opportunity to integrate holistic approaches to UX/UI development and software engineering by drawing upon and unifying past professional experiences in:</p> 
<ul>      
     <li> advertising & marketing, </li>
     <li> 1099/app/gig economy work,</li>
     <li> audio/visual content creation,</li>
     <li> conflict mediation,</li>
     <li>entrepreneurship,</li> 
     <li> event promotion, </li>
     <li>graphic design,</li> 
     <li> live performance, </li>
     <li> office administration,</li>
     <li> street outreach,</li>
     <li>photography, </li> 
     <li> professional organizing, </li>
     <li> social media management,</li>
     <li> real estate marketing,</li>
     <li> logistics warehouse work,</li>
     <li> wellness research</li> 

     </ul>


     <p> Based on the diversity of these accumulated experiences, I feel confident and enthusiastic about adding my perspective to user stories, research, prototyping, and more in collaboration with my team and stakeholders as we add value to our end users' experience.  </p>
      
<p>     In conclusion, as a front-end developer, I aim to listen, communicate, research, and deliver solutions to present clients with front-end user interfaces (UI) that provide an easy user experience (UX). Finally, I strive to prioritize commenting & readability, test-driven development, and engineering loosely coupled code when engineering software for the back-end and through middlewares. </p>    </div>
